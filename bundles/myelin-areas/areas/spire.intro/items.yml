        On The Spire: |
          The voice begins, 'The Spire was created after the truce between the Ranvierii Associations and the Anzeige Empire...' A time-lapse animation of the Spire being raised is projected from the crystal, starting with mountain-sized machines flattening the earth, and ending with flying automatons hauling chunks of the structure's massive carapace to its very top.

          'Declaring themselves the bastion of civilization, the peoples conspired to transcend the rest of humanity by taking on projects previously thought to be impossible...' A series of glyphs appear above the crystal, and the voice echoes in your head in a monotone chant:

          'Ex Nihilo'
          ... An image of a tall, thin woman standing before a dais. An indigo light shimmers as they slide a device into a hole on the top of the structure.
          The image cuts to a flat plain, and the same shimmering light fills the air. Before your eyes, a mountain erupts into the sky...

          'Ungenocide'
          ... A scene of a dead body, being hauled from the gutter by an automaton. Their piercing green eyes stare lifelessly.
          An image of the person's face, in one of the cylinders surrounding you, flashes before you.
          The green eyes open, a look of shock on their face...

          'Sacredname'
          ...A man and a woman are in an otherwise empty room, sitting cross-legged, deep in thought. 
          They both mouth a word at the same time, shimmer, and vanish...

          'Extropy'
          ...A person is in the center of a dark, cylindrical chamber. They stand before a glass vat filled with a glittering liquid. 
          They thrust their arm into the liquid, and their skin cracks, becoming hard and scaled...

          The voice intones,

          'WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?'
        On Project Ex Nihilo: "A monotone voice begins reciting data, punctuated by bursts of static to remove confidential information:\nPROJECT EX NIHILO:\nStart date: ██████\nCompletion date: ██████ Principal scientists: Mahabharata ███████, Elegans ██████, J. Icahn ████████████\n\nPRELIMINARY RESULTS:\nWhile experiments in physical immortality have been abject failures, resulting in loss of █████ subjects and the discovery of ██ new cancers, research in the direction of consciousness transfer as a vehicle for immortality has seen a promising ██% success rate.\n\nThus far, all subjects have survived, however many suffer from various forms of amnesia, loss of motor function, ████████ of the ████, and post-transfer depression.

        On The Automaton Uprising: |
          A man's voice begins, in a hurried and breathless tone:
          'I hope this can save someone's life. It's too late for me. 
          
          Something has happened to the automatons here in the spire. It started this morning when a
          few experiments were ruined by what seemed to be a routine malfunction.

          Midday, there was an announcement: We were to decommission any automatons behaving abnormally.

          Rumors began to spread. Regardless of the cause, some of the automatons had learned to betray a root-level directive, the command to do no harm. This aberration seemed to spread like a virus and within the last few minutes, it reached our floor. A battle erupted and *the voice chokes up for a minute* we lost. We were overwhelmed, even with the handful of security drones that were still on our side.

          I am bleeding far too much to be able to escape. *the voice laughs mirthlessly*

          My last acts are to record this message, and to enable a security fence that will hopefully prevent the automatons from slaughtering anyone unlucky enough to be revived on this floor.

          If you're listening to this, they should be confined to the north end of the floor. Be careful.'

          The message ends with a short burst of static.
